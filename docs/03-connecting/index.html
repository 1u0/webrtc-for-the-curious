<a class=anchor href=#why-do-i-need-a-dedicated-subsystem-for-connecting>#</a></h2><p>WwbRTC will go to great lengths to achieve direct bi-directional communication between two WebRTC Agents. These agents may even be in different networks with no direct communication between agents, by using NAT Traversal WebRTC can make communication happen. NAT Traversal is a networking technique that enables communication between two peers that can&rsquo;t directly connect.</p><p>In situations where direct connectivity doesn&rsquo;t exist and NAT Traversal fails WebRTC has other techniques. You can then use a TURN server to communicate across protocols (UDP &lt;-> TCP) and versions (IPv4 &lt;-> IPv6).</p><p>Because WebRTC has these attributes you get these advantages over traditional Client/Server technology.</p><h3 id=reduced-bandwidth-costs>Reduced Bandwidth Costs
<a class=anchor href=#reduced-bandwidth-costs>#</a></h3><p>Since media communication happens directly during peers you don&rsquo;t have to pay for transporting it.</p><h3 id=lower-latency>Lower Latency
<a class=anchor href=#lower-latency>#</a></h3><p>Communication is faster when it is direct! When a user had to run everything through you server it makes things slower.</p><h3 id=secure-e2e-communication>Secure E2E Communication
<a class=anchor href=#secure-e2e-communication>#</a></h3><p>Direct Communication is more secure. Since users aren&rsquo;t routing your data through your server they don&rsquo;t even need to trust you won&rsquo;t decrypt it.</p><h2 id=how-does-it-work>How does it work?
<a class=anchor href=#how-does-it-work>#</a></h2><p>The process described above is <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8445>ICE</a>. Another protocol that pre-dates WebRTC.</p><p>ICE is a protocol that tries to find the best way to communicate between two ICE Agents. Each ICE Agents publishes the ways it is reachable, these are known as candidates. ICE then determines the best candidate pairing of candidates.</p><p>The actual ICE Process is described in greater detail later in this chapter. To understand why ICE exists it is useful to understand what network behaviors were are overcoming.</p><h2 id=networking-real-world-constraints>Networking real world constraints
<a class=anchor href=#networking-real-world-constraints>#</a></h2><p>ICE is all about overcoming the constraints of real world networks. Before we even explore the solution lets talk about the actual problems.</p><h3 id=not-in-the-same-network>Not in the same network
<a class=anchor href=#not-in-the-same-network>#</a></h3><p>Most of the time the other WebRTC Agent will not even be in the same network. A typical call is usually between two WebRTC Agents in different networks with no direct connectivity.</p><p>Below is a graph of two distinct networks, connected by the public internet. Then in each network you have two hosts.</p><script src=/mermaid.min.js></script><script>mermaid.initialize({flowchart:{useMaxWidth:true}});</script><p class=mermaid>graph TB
subgraph netb ["Network B (IP Address 5.0.0.2)"]
b3["Agent 3 (IP 192.168.0.1)"]
b4["Agent 4 (IP 192.168.0.1)"]
routerb["Router B"]
end
subgraph neta ["Network A (IP Address 5.0.0.1)"]
routera["Router A"]
a1["Agent 1 (IP 192.168.0.1)"]
a2["Agent 2 (IP 192.168.0.1)"]
end
pub{Public Internet}
routera-->pub
routerb-->pub</p><p>For the hosts in the same network it is very easy to connect. <code>192.168.0.1 -> 192.168.0.2</code> is easy to do! However a host using <code>Router B</code> has no way to directly access anything using <code>Router A</code>. A host using <code>Router B</code> could send traffic directly to <code>Router A</code>, but the request would end there.</p><h3 id=protocol-restrictions>Protocol Restrictions
<a class=anchor href=#protocol-restrictions>#</a></h3><p>Some networks don&rsquo;t allow UDP traffic at all, or maybe they don&rsquo;t allow TCP. Some networks have a very low MTU. There are lots of variables that network administrators can change that can make communication difficult.</p><h3 id=firewallids-rules>Firewall/IDS Rules
<a class=anchor href=#firewallids-rules>#</a></h3><p>Another is &lsquo;Deep Packet Inspection&rsquo; and other intelligent filtering. Some network administrators will run software that tries to process every packet. Many times this software doesn&rsquo;t understand WebRTC, so blocks because it doesn&rsquo;t know what to do</p><h2 id=network-address-translation-and-addressport-mapping>Network Address Translation and Address/Port Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#network-address-translation-and-addressport-mapping>#</a></h2><p>NAT Mapping is the magic that makes the connectivity of WebRTC possible, even when the peers can&rsquo;t access each other on their own. With this you can have two peers in completely different networks communicating directly.</p><p>Again we have a <code>Agent 1</code> and <code>Agent 2</code> and they are in different networks. However traffic is flowing completely through. Visualized that looks like.</p><p class=mermaid>graph TB

routera-.->pub;
pub-.->routerb;
routerb-.->b2;</p><p>To makes this possible you need to establish a NAT Mapping first. NAT mapping will feel like an automated/config-less version of doing port forwarding in your router.</p><p>The downside to NAT Mapping is that that network behavior is inconsistent between networks. ISPs and hardware manufacturers do it in different ways for their own reasons. In some cases network administrators may even disable it.
The full range of behaviors is understood and observable, so a ICE Agent is able to confirm it created a NAT Mapping, and the attributes of the mapping.</p><p>The document that describes these behaviors is <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4787>RFC 4787</a></p><h3 id=creating-a-mapping>Creating a Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#creating-a-mapping>#</a></h3><p>Creating a mapping is the easiest part. When you send a packet to an address outside your network, a mapping is created! If the server then responds to your request the response will be delivered back to the host that sent it.
The server can respond with multiple packets back to your single message.</p><p>The details around mappings is where it gets complicated.</p><h3 id=mapping-creation-behaviors>Mapping Creation Behaviors
<a class=anchor href=#mapping-creation-behaviors>#</a></h3><p>These are the rules for when a new mapping is created. They fall into three different categories.</p><h4 id=endpoint-independent-mapping>Endpoint Independent Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#endpoint-independent-mapping>#</a></h4><p>One mapping is created for each sender inside the NAT. If you send two packets to different remote addresses the NAT Mapping will be re-used. Both remote hosts could then respond and it would be sent back to the same local listener.</p><p>This is the best case scenario. For a call to work at least one side MUST be of this type.</p><h4 id=address-dependent-mapping>Address Dependent Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#address-dependent-mapping>#</a></h4><p>A new mapping is created every time you send to a new address. If you send two packets to different hosts two mappings will be created. If you send two packets to the same remote host, but different destination ports a new mapping will NOT be created.</p><h4 id=address-and-port-dependent-mapping>Address and Port Dependent Mapping
<a class=anchor href=#address-and-port-dependent-mapping>#</a></h4><p>A new mapping is created if the remote IP or Port is different. If you send two packets to the same remote host, but different destination ports a new mapping will be created.</p><h3 id=mapping-filtering-behaviors>Mapping Filtering Behaviors
<a class=anchor href=#mapping-filtering-behaviors>#</a></h3><p>Mapping filtering are the rules around who is allowed to use the mapping. They fall into three similar classifications.</p><h4 id=endpoint-independent-filtering>Endpoint Independent Filtering
<a class=anchor href=#endpoint-independent-filtering>#</a></h4><p>Anyone can use the mapping. After you create the mapping by sending a packet that mapping can be used by anyone on the internet.</p><h4 id=address-dependent-filtering>Address Dependent Filtering
<a class=anchor href=#address-dependent-filtering>#</a></h4><p>Only the host the mapping was created for can use the mapping. If you send a packet to host <code>A</code> it can respond back with as many packets as it wants. If host <code>B</code> attempts to send a packet to that mapping it will be ignored.</p><h4 id=address-and-port-dependent-filtering>Address and Port Dependent Filtering
<a class=anchor href=#address-and-port-dependent-filtering>#</a></h4><p>Only the host and port the mapping was created for can use the mapping. If you send a packet to host <code>A:5000</code> it can respond back with as many packets as it wants. If host <code>A:5001</code> attempts to send a packet to that mapping it will be ignored.</p><h3 id=mapping-refresh>Mapping Refresh
<a class=anchor href=#mapping-refresh>#</a></h3><p>It is recommended that if a mapping is unused for 5 minutes it should be destroyed. This is entirely up to the ISP or hardware manufacturer.</p><h2 id=stun-session-traversal-utilities-for-nat>STUN (Session Traversal Utilities for NAT)
<a class=anchor href=#stun-session-traversal-utilities-for-nat>#</a></h2><p>STUN is a protocol designed for dealing with NATs, it is a tool that is used by ICE but existed before ICE as well. It is defined by <a href=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389>RFC 5389</a></p><h2 id=turn->TURN ()
