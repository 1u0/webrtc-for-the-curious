The only intention of this book is to make the world a better place. WebRTC is a wonderful technology but is difficult to use. Politics and commercial interests have made it more difficult then it needs to be.

# What is this book.

WebRTC for the curious is an Open Source book written for those that are always looking for more. This book was created by WebRTC implementors to share their hard earned knowledge with the world.

This is book is not a tutorial, and will not contain code. We will not be talking about any particular software, but all about protocols and APIs.

This book is for when that thorny production issue hits. This book is for when you are building your one of a kind idea.

# What is WebRTC.

WebRTC is an API and Protocol that connects two machines. Once connected it then allows the exchange of encrypted media and data.

We will grow from these concepts, but this is where it all starts from.

WebRTC is not software, but a standard for software to implement. Like HTTP it is a protocol. There are definitions for how network traffic should



# Why should I use WebRTC?

This is a common question for people in the exploration stage. When building a prototype WebRTC can be frustrating, but this is why in 6 months you will applaud your decision.
