# What is WebRTC.

WebRTC is both an API and Protocol. The WebRTC protocol is a set of rules for two hosts to negotiate bi-directional secure communication. The WebRTC API was designed just for Javascript. This Javascript API then allows web developers to use the WebRTC protocol.

A similar relationship would be HTTP and the fetch API. WebRTC the protocol would be HTTP, and WebRTC the API would be the fetch API.

Many other APIs, servers and tools exist for WebRTC. All of these implementations can interact with each others.

# Why should I learn WebRTC?

These are the things that WebRTC will give you. This list is not exhaustive but is some of the things you may appreciate during your journey. Don't worry if you don't know some of these terms yet, this book will teach you them along tne way.

* Open Standard
* Multiple Implementations
* Available in Browsers
* Mandatory Encryption
* NAT Traversal
* Repurposed existing technology
* Congestion Control
* Sub-Second Latency

# How does WebRTC (the protocol) Work

This is a question that takes an entire book to explain. However, to start of we break it  into four steps.

* Signaling
* Connecting
* Securing
* Communicating 

These four steps happen sequentially. The prior step must be 100% successful for the subsequent one to even begun. At a high level this is what each one of these steps is accomplishing.
