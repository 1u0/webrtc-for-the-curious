# What is this book.

WebRTC for the curious is an Open Source book written for those that are always looking for more. This book was created by WebRTC implementors to share their hard earned knowledge about WebRTC with the world.

This book is all about protocols and APIs. We want to cover all the things that the tutorials have missed. If you are interested in learning about the Javascript API or some other particular software this book might not be the best resource.

This book is for when that thorny production issue hits, or when you are about to ship your one of a kind idea. You will be armed with the knowledge to debug every piece of WebRTC.
