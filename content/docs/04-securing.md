## What security does WebRTC have?
Every WebRTC connection is authenticated and encrypted. You can be confident that a 3rd paert can't what you are sending. They also can't insert bogus messages. You can also be sure the WebRTC Agent that generated the Session Description is the one you are communicating with.

It is very important that no one tampers with those messages. It is ok if a 3rd party reads the Session Description in transit. However WebRTC has no protection against it being modified. An attacker could MITM you by changing ICE Candidates and the Certificate Fingerprint.


## How does it work?

WebRTC uses two pre-existing protocols [DTLS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347) and [SRTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3711)

DTLS is a protocol that allows you to exchange data securely between two peers. It is a sibling of TLS, the same technology tbat powers HTTPS. SRTP is a protocol designed just for exchanging media. There are some optimizations we can make by using it instead of DTLS.

DTLS is used first. It does a handshake over the connection provided by ICE. DTLS is a client/server protocol, so one side needs to start the handshake. The Client is chosen during signaling, it is usually the answerer. During the DTLS handshake both sides offer a certificate. After the handshake is complete this certificate is compared to the certificate hash in the Session Description. This is to assert that the handshake happened with the WebRTC Agent you expected. The DTLS connection is then available to be used for DataChannel communication.

To create a SRTP session we initialize it from the keys generated by DTLS. SRTP has no way to handshake, so has to be bootstrapped with external keys. When this is done media can be exchanged that is encrypted via SRTP!


## Security 101
To understand the technology presented in this chapter you will need to understand these terms first. Cryptography is a tricky subject so would be worth consulting other sources also!

#### Cipher
Cipher is a series of steps that takes plaintext to ciphertext. The cipher then be reversed so you can take your ciphertext back to plaintext.

A simple cipher is ROT13. Each letter is moved 13 characters foward. To undo the cipher you move 13 characters backwards. The plaintext `HELLO` would become the ciphertext `URYYB`

#### Plaintext/Ciphertext
Plaintext is the input to a cipher. Ciphertext is the output of a cipher.

#### Hash
Hash is a one way process that generates a digest. This is useful when you want to check


#### Public/Private Key


#### Perfect Forward Secrecy
#### Diffie-Helman

#### Certificate
